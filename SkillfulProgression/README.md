# Skillful Progression
Skillful Progression reworks the manner in which skill gain is attributed. By introducing specific conditions during rare, skilled, or difficult events an increased XP incentive is provided to ensure that players are rewarded for their risk as they progress into "endgame" content.

## Installation (manual)
* Place the directory into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## Features
* All RaiseSkill events attribute XP as a function of damage dealt, ensuring that XP scales as the player progresses.
* Bows provide XP incentives for hitting longshots.
* Spears provide XP incentives for hitting longshots, as well as having an additional multiplier just because of difficulty making longshots connect.
* Swords and maces provide XP incentives for hitting the secondary attack.
* Shields provide incentives for successful parries.
* Knives provide incentives for stealthy backstabs, with additional multipliers for a kill.
* Battleaxe provides incentives for connecting the first hit of the primary without player taking damage.
